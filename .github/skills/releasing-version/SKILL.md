# Releasing Version Skill

Automate the process of managing releases, including:

- updating documentation,
- generating changelogs,
- and handling versioning.

Use terminal git commands as needed.

## Step 1: Update Documentation

- [ ] [AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md): update to reflect changes.
  - tech stack,
  - setup/dev instructions,
  - folder structure are accurate.
- [ ] other relevant project files (`package.json` ...).

## Step 2: Generate Changelog

- [ ] Commit all pending changes grouping them by type of change.
- [ ] Use [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](.) principles.
- [ ] [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md): Add entries based on commit history.

## Step 3: Versioning

- [ ] If there is an issue/ticket id in the context, commit with `Close #ID`.
- [ ] Merge it into default branch.
- [ ] Generate a git tag for the new version.
